# EasyEnchanting
Minecraft Enchanting Plugin

## What is it?
EasyEnchanting is a plugin for your Minecraft server to enable faster and more powerful enchantments.

## How do I install it?
Download the binary file located in /bin and drop it into the plugins folder of your server's root directory.

## Wow, that was super easy! How do I use it?
The syntax is just as simple. To enchant an item, issue the following server command:

`/enchant+ <Name> [Level] [Player]`

If you do not specify a level, the plugin will assume level 1.
If no player is specified, the plugin assumes the player that issued the command.

**In order to use the command from the console, you *must* specify a player.**
